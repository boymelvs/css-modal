## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out.

## Overview

This is another very common pattern on the web.

### Check

-  The blue icon is aligned to the left.
-  There is equal space on either side of the icon (the gaps between the icon and the edge of the card, and the icon and the text, are the same).
-  There is padding around the edge of the modal.
-  The header, text, and buttons are aligned with each other.
-  The header is bold and a slightly larger text-size than the text.
-  The close button is vertically aligned with the header, and aligned in the top-right of the card.
